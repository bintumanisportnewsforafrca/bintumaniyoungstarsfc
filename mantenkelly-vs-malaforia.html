  <p>The pressure continued as Malaforia struggled to keep possession. Mantenkelly doubled their lead midway through the first half, capitalizing on a defensive error. A miscleared ball landed perfectly for the attacking midfielder, who smashed it into the top corner, sending the crowd wild.</p>

  <p>At 2–0, it looked like the game would be a one-sided affair. However, Malaforia had other plans. Just before halftime, they pulled one back through a well-worked team goal, making it 2–1 and setting the stage for an intense second half.</p>

Their efforts were rewarded with a second goal in the 58th minute after a long-range effort caught the Mantenkelly goalkeeper slightly off his line. With the score level at 2–2, the momentum shifted, and both teams went all out for the win.</p>

  <p>But it was Mantenkelly who rose to the occasion. In the 72nd minute, a beautifully delivered free-kick from the right side found the towering center-back, who nodded home the winning goal — his first ever for the club. That goal sealed the 3–2 victory and sent the Mantenkelly bench into celebration.</p>
